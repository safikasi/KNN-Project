# 🔮 KNN Wizardry: Predicting the Unseen with Magic Neighbors!  

✨ *"The right neighbor can change everything!"* ✨  

Welcome to my **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Project** – where data points find their perfect squad and make predictions with uncanny accuracy! 🧙‍♂️🔍

## 🌟 Project Spellbook  

### 🧪 The Potion of Data Alchemy  
- Transformed raw data into **golden insights** through meticulous preprocessing  
- Conjured **scaled features** to give every variable equal magical power  
- Banished bias with a flick of our **normalization wand**  

### 🔮 Crystal Ball Performance  
Our first prophecy had **75% accuracy** – good, but not magical enough!  

**After our mystical retraining ritual (K=30 incantation):**  

✨ Accuracy Boost: 75% → 84% (+9% magic power!)

✨ Precision & Recall: Balanced at 0.84 (Perfect harmony!)

*We found the sweet spot where K=30 makes the error rate tremble!*  

### ⚖️ The Scale of Justice

## 🏰 Why Choose This Magic?  

KNN is like having **a council of wise neighbors** who:

🔹 Adapt to any pattern (non-linear boundaries welcome)  
🔹 Grow wiser with more data (scalable sorcery)  

Perfect for when you need:  
- Quick divinations
